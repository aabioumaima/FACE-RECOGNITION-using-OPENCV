# FACE-RECOGNITION-using-OPENCV|Computer-Vison

This project consists on detecting the face using the OpenCV librarie; training the model with some images and then test it and calculate the distance to see if the results match
or not.

Please note that :
 - We used PyCharm as IDE to run this code.
 - Download all the package needed in order to run it ( cmake, dlib, face_recognition, numpy, opencv-python)
 - You're free to take any images you want.

In the second project Face Recognition Attendance Project, we will run the code in real time on different images.
